# ♻️ Parivartan – Smart Waste Management Platform

> **Turning Awareness into Action — One Household at a Time**

Parivartan is an AI-powered, technology-driven waste management platform that digitally connects **citizens**, **waste collection partners**, and **administrators** in one unified ecosystem. It promotes proper solid waste segregation at source, real-time pickup tracking, environmental impact monitoring, and reward-based participation — aligned with India's **Swachh Bharat Mission**.

---

## 🌍 The Problem We Solve

India generates over **62 million tonnes** of waste annually. Despite cleanliness campaigns, the most critical step — **segregation at source** — remains widely ignored.

- Households mix biodegradable, plastic, and recyclable waste
- Recyclable materials end up in landfills due to improper separation
- Rural and semi-urban areas lack structured digital waste solutions
- No single platform connects citizens, collectors, and recyclers

**Parivartan bridges this gap.**

## 🔄 How It Works

### 👤 User Flow
1. Register / Log in to the app
2. Upload a waste image (optional)
3. AI identifies and suggests the correct waste category
4. Schedule a pickup — select category, address, and time
5. Request is stored in Firestore; nearby partner gets notified
6. Track pickup status in real time
7. Partner collects waste and marks request as completed
8. User receives confirmation + reward points
9. Environmental impact dashboard is updated automatically

### 👨‍💼 Partner Flow
1. Register as a collection partner
2. Admin verifies and approves the partner account
3. View assigned waste pickup requests on dashboard
4. Accept request and navigate to pickup location
5. Update status: `Assigned → In Progress → Completed`
6. Earn reward points for successful collections
7. Collection data syncs with admin analytics panel

### 🧑‍💻 Admin Flow
1. Log into admin dashboard
2. Review and approve partner registrations
3. Monitor all active and completed pickup requests
4. Track waste collection statistics and CO₂ reduction metrics
5. Manage rewards, users, and system settings

## 🤖 AI & Intelligence Layer
Parivartan uses a multi-model AI architecture combining on-device inference, cloud intelligence, and real-time data processing.

### 1️⃣ On-Device AI — TensorFlow Lite (Mobile App)
The mobile app runs a TensorFlow Lite model directly on the user's device for instant waste image classification — no internet required.
Feature     Detail
Model Type  Image Classification (Waste Categories)
Framework   TensorFlow LiteWorks 
Offline     ✅ Yes
Categories  Plastic / Paper / Metal

#### Why TensorFlow Lite?

Optimized and lightweight for mobile hardware
Offline capability — works in low-connectivity rural areas
Faster response with no server round-trip
Reduces backend load and cost


### 2️⃣ Cloud AI — Gemini API (Web Platform)
The web platform integrates Google Gemini for higher-level intelligence and data-driven insights beyond simple classification.

#### Gemini powers:

📊 Intelligent waste analytics and trend detection
🌱 Environmental impact suggestions and recommendations
🧠 AI-powered decision support for administrators
📈 Smart performance insights for collection partners


### 3️⃣ Real-Time Data Processing — Pathway
Pathway handles all live data streaming and dynamic analytics across the platform.

#### Pathway enables:

⚡ Real-time waste data streaming as pickups happen
